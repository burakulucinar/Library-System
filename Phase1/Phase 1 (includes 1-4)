Introduction
    Online Complaint Management System (SCT CMS) allows users to report complaints in a company to submit their 
complaints about malfunctioning equipment or other equipment they are using so that people in charge of 
maintenance of the complaints can respond to user under an online system. The Online Complaint Management 
System is developed for The School of Computing and Technology in Eastern Mediterranean University.

	For an environment such as The School of Computing and Technology, which is largely based around computer systems, maintaining 
complaints about hardware, software, or other complaints can often get frustrating as the department is currently using phone 
calls to report complaints for maintenance.   SCT CMS aims to overcome this issue by providing an easy to use, well-built 
system and help make the working environment a much more comfortable place to work in.

    • Provide simple complaint submission for complainant.
    • Keep track of complaint handling phase.
    • Enable complainants to comment on a complaint.
