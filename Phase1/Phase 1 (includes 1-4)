Introduction
    Online Complaint Management System (SCT CMS) allows users to report complaints in a company to submit their 
complaints about malfunctioning equipment or other equipment they are using so that people in charge of 
maintenance of the complaints can respond to user under an online system. The Online Complaint Management 
System is developed for The School of Computing and Technology in Eastern Mediterranean University.

	For an environment such as The School of Computing and Technology, which is largely based around computer systems, maintaining 
complaints about hardware, software, or other complaints can often get frustrating as the department is currently using phone 
calls to report complaints for maintenance.   SCT CMS aims to overcome this issue by providing an easy to use, well-built 
system and help make the working environment a much more comfortable place to work in. 
1.1 Project Objectives
The main aim of our project is to 
    • Provide easy to use GUI. 
    • Provide simple complaint submission for complainant.
    • Keep track of complaint handling phase.
    • Enable complainants to comment on a complaint.
    • Keep the complaints organized and recorded.  
    • Keep the complaint history.
    • Enable administrator handle adding, editing and deleting users.
    • Enable administrator handle adding, editing and deleting floors.
    • Enable administrator handle adding, editing and deleting rooms.
    • Enable administrator handle adding, editing and deleting equipment.
    • Enable administrator handle adding, editing and deleting categories.
	The core idea of the system is handling complaints in a simple and precise way. To state a complaint about a specific problem can get 
  very difficult, so, to minimize the frustration, our system simplifies the complaint submission and maintenance process.   

1.2 Project Scope and Constraints
  This project involves the creation of the SCT Complaint Management System (SCT CMS) which is an online system built to handle complaint 
submissions and keep track of complaint maintenance. The system is built to submit complaints for maintenance, and get a reply from the 
maintenance office indicating the status of the complaint. The project will be completed by 23 May 2017.
